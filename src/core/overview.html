<p>Terrier is a modular platform for the rapid development of
large-scale Information Retrieval applications, providing 
indexing and retrieval functionalities. Terrier is based on 
the Divergence from Randomness (DFR) framework. It can index 
various document collections, including the standard TREC 
collections, such as AP, WSJ, WT10G, .GOV and .GOV2. It also 
provides a wide range of parameter-free weighting approaches 
and full-text search algorithms, aiming to offer a public 
testbed for performing Information Retrieval experiments.</p>
