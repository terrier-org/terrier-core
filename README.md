:mag: [Terrier](http://terrier.org) is a highly flexible, efficient, and effective open source search engine, readily deployable on large-scale collections of documents. Terrier implements state-of-the-art indexing and retrieval functionalities, and provides an ideal platform for the rapid development and evaluation of large-scale retrieval applications.

Terrier is open source, and is a comprehensive, flexible and transparent platform for research and experimentation in text retrieval. [Research can easily be carried out](https://github.com/terrier-org/terrier-core/blob/5.x/doc/bibliography.md) on standard [TREC](http://trec.nist.gov/) and [CLEF](http://www.clef-initiative.eu/) test collections.

:coffee: Terrier is written in Java, and is developed at the School of Computing Science, [University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/).

The latest version of Terrier can be found at https://github.com/terrier-org/terrier-core/

:new: :snake: New in 2020, Terrier has Python bindings called [PyTerrier](https://github.com/terrier-org/pyterrier). PyTerrier allows experiments to be conducted in a succinct, declarative manner, including in Jupyter or Colab notebooks, while benefiting from the flexibility of Terrier.
