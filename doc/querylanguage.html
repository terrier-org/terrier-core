</br><br><h1>Query Language</h1>
<p>Terrier offers a flexible and powerful query language for searching with
phrases, fields, or specifying that terms are required to appear in the 
retrieved documents. Some examples of queries are the following:</p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>term1 term2 </td><td>retrieves documents that contain term1 or term2 (they do not need to contain both of them).</td></tr>
<tr><td>{term1 term2} </td><td>retrieves documents that contain term1 or term2, where they are treated as synonyms of each other (they do not need to contain both of them).</td></tr>
<tr><td>term1^2.3</td><td>the weight of term1 is multiplied by 2.3.</td></tr>
<tr><td>+term1 +term2</td><td>retrieves documents that contain both term1 
                             and term2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>+term1 -term2</td><td>retrieves documents that contain term1 and
                             do not contain term2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>title:term1 </td><td>retrieves documents that contain term1 in the title field (<a href="configure_indexing.html#fields">Field indexing</a> must be configured to record the title field).</td></tr>                         
<tr><td>title:(term1 term2) </td><td>retrieves documents that contain term1 or term2 in the title field (<a href="configure_indexing.html#fields">Field indexing</a> must be configured to record the title field).</td></tr>   
<tr><td>term1 -title:term2 </td><td>retrieves documents that contain term1, but must not contain term2 in the title field.</td></tr>                         

<tr><td>&quot;term1 term2&quot;</td><td>retrieves documents where the terms term1
                             and term2 appear in a phrase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&quot;term1 term2&quot;~n</td><td>retrieves documents where the terms term1
                             and term2 appear within a distance of n
                             blocks. The order of the terms is not
                             considered.</td></tr>
                            
</table>  

<p>Combinations of the different constructs are possible as well. For 
example, the query <tt>term1 term2 -&quot;term1 term2&quot;</tt> would retrieve all the documents that contain at least one of the terms
term1 and term2, but not the documents where the phrase &quot;term1 term2&quot; appears.</p>

<p>Note that in some configurations, the Terrier query language may not be available by default. In particular, if batch processing queries from a
file using a class that extends <a href="javadoc/org/terrier/applications/batchquerying/TRECQuery.html">TRECQuery</a>, then the queries are pre-processed by a tokeniser
that may remove the query language characters (e.g. brackets and colons). To use the Terrier query language in this case, you should
use <a href="javadoc/org/terrier/applications/batchquerying/SingleLineTRECQuery.html">SingleLineTRECQuery</a> and set <tt>SingleLineTRECQuery.tokenise</tt> to false in the <tt>terrier.properties</tt> file.</p>
